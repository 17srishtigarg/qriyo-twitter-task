Write a simple <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation">Twitter API</a> client in PHP. This client simply has to fetch and display Tweets that <br><br>
      a) Have been re-Tweeted at least once <br>
      b) Contain the hashtag #hometutor

Why we are asking you to do this: We believe that code is poetry. This short, simple test will help you demonstrate not just your programming talent, but your approach to designing an application. We donâ€™t just want to see the coder in you - we want to see the engineer and a great startup developer.

***Plan well*** - The goal here is not to finish the task as quickly as possible, but to demonstrate your careful thinking and planning.<br><br>
***Write for the future*** - Write your code as if someone else will be working with it the next day. That person should be able to hit the ground running immediately.<br><br>
***Keep dependencies to a minimum*** - Importing a twitter SDK/API-client would be sensible for this task, but using a full-featured web framework would probably be overkill.<br><br>
***Publicly accessible*** - Present the solution as a publicly accessible URL
